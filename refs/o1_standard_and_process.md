# O-1 Standard and Adjudication Process (USCIS Policy Summary)

## A. Standard for Classification

### O-1A (Sciences, Education, Business, Athletics)
To qualify as an alien of “extraordinary ability” (O-1A), the beneficiary must have **sustained national or international acclaim**, and achievements recognized through extensive documentation.

**Extraordinary ability (O-1A)** means:  
A level of expertise indicating the person is **one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top** of the field of endeavor.

### O-1B (Arts)
To qualify under O-1B (Arts), the beneficiary must have **sustained national or international acclaim** and **distinction**.

**Distinction (O-1B Arts)** means:  
A high level of achievement evidenced by skill and recognition **substantially above** that ordinarily encountered such that the person is **prominent, renowned, leading, or well-known** in the field of arts.

### O-1B (Motion Picture / Television, “MPTV”)
For O-1B (MPTV), the beneficiary must have a **demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement**.

**Extraordinary achievement (O-1B MPTV)** means:  
A very high level of accomplishment, evidenced by skill and recognition **significantly above** that ordinarily encountered such that the person is **outstanding, notable, or leading** in the motion picture/television field.

## Determining the Relevant Standard for Artists with Some Connection to MPTV

Sometimes an artist’s work includes some motion picture/television elements, making it unclear whether O-1B (Arts) or O-1B (MPTV) applies.

### How USCIS evaluates “MPTV production”
USCIS analysis is **not limited** to whether a production airs on TV or in theaters. The industry can include some online content.

Generally **within MPTV**:
- Streaming movies
- Web series
- Commercials
- Programs with formats corresponding to traditional motion picture or television productions

Generally **not within MPTV**:
- Static web materials
- Self-produced video blogs
- Social media content (typically)

### Which classification applies?
USCIS generally applies **O-1B (MPTV)** requirements if the beneficiary will perform services for MPTV productions in the U.S., even if they also do other non-MPTV work.

If an artist’s appearance on an MPTV production is **incidental** to non-MPTV work (e.g., being interviewed, demonstrating, or promoting their work), then O-1B (MPTV) may not be appropriate and they may instead seek **O-1B (Arts)**.

USCIS generally considers **paid professionals employed by the production** (interview hosts, crew, etc.) as working in MPTV, while **contestants** in reality productions are generally not considered working in MPTV.

## B. Determining Eligibility for O-1 Classification (Two-Step Framework)

For Form I-129, USCIS applies a two-step analysis:

### Step 1 — Satisfy the Evidentiary Requirements (Threshold)
The petition must include either:
- Evidence of a qualifying major award (or nomination, if applicable), **or**
- Evidence meeting **at least 3** applicable evidentiary criteria

At this step, USCIS evaluates whether the evidence fits the **parameters of the regulation** for each criterion.  
**No determination is made yet** about whether the evidence proves extraordinary ability/achievement.

### Step 2 — Totality of the Evidence (Final Merits Determination)
Even if 3+ criteria are met, that does **not automatically** establish eligibility.

USCIS evaluates the **totality** of evidence to determine whether the beneficiary meets the relevant standard:

- **O-1A:** sustained acclaim and among the small percentage at the very top
- **O-1B (Arts):** sustained acclaim and distinction in the arts
- **O-1B (MPTV):** extraordinary achievement in MPTV with very high accomplishment / outstanding recognition

If USCIS denies, the officer should articulate specific reasons why the record does not establish eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence.

## Continuing Work in the Area of Extraordinary Ability / Achievement

### O-1A and O-1B (Arts)
USCIS interprets “area of extraordinary ability” broadly. It can include:
- The occupation(s) where the beneficiary gained acclaim, and
- Other related occupations sharing skillsets/knowledge/expertise

Relevant factors:
- Same or related industry; shared duties/expertise
- Prospective role is supervisory/leadership requiring shared knowledge
- It is common for people in one occupation to transition to the other

### O-1B (MPTV)
USCIS interprets “area of extraordinary achievement” to include any proposed work within the **MPTV industry**.
