# O-1B (Arts) Evidentiary Criteria

To support an O-1B (Arts) petition, the petitioner must show either:
- A significant national/international award or nomination (e.g., Academy Award, Emmy, Grammy, DGA), OR
- At least **3** of the criteria below.

> Note: Like O-1A, meeting 3 criteria is a threshold; USCIS then evaluates the totality of evidence.

---

## Criterion 1 — Lead/Starring in Distinguished Productions or Events
### Definition
Evidence that the beneficiary has performed, and will perform, as a **lead or starring participant** in productions or events of **distinguished reputation**.

### Required evidence types
- Critical reviews
- Advertisements
- Publicity releases
- Publications
- Contracts
- Endorsements

### Considerations
- Lead = principal role; starring = great prominence relative to others
- Distinguished reputation indicators: critical reception, high attendance, commercial success, etc.
- Prospective reputation may rely on advance publicity/endorsements and reputation of related entities
- Promotional materials count; **unpublished testimonial letters alone do not** satisfy this criterion’s evidence-type list

---

## Criterion 2 — National/International Recognition (Published Material)
### Definition
Evidence of national or international recognition for achievements, shown by critical reviews or other published materials **by or about** the beneficiary in major newspapers, trade journals, magazines, or other publications (including online and transcripts).

### Considerations
- Material can be about a broader production/topic if it discusses the beneficiary and/or their work substantially and mentions them in connection to it
- Officers consider both content and the stature/circulation of the publication

---

## Criterion 3 — Lead/Starring/Critical Role for Distinguished Organizations
### Definition
Evidence that the beneficiary performed, and will perform, in a lead, starring, or **critical role** for organizations/establishments with a **distinguished reputation**.

### Evidence types
- Articles/publications about the org (or division)
- Testimonials/letters detailing role and reputation (with author credentials and basis of knowledge)

### Considerations
- “Critical” means integral/important to goals/activities relative to peers
- Distinguished reputation factors: customer base scale, longevity, media coverage
- Org need not directly employ the beneficiary

---

## Criterion 4 — Major Commercial or Critically Acclaimed Successes
### Definition
Record of major commercial or critically acclaimed successes, evidenced by indicators such as title, rating, standing, box office receipts, TV ratings, and other achievements reported in trade journals, major newspapers, or other publications (print/online/transcripts).

### Considerations
- Publication may be about a production, not necessarily primarily about the beneficiary
- Should connect the production’s success to the beneficiary’s success (attribution/role importance)
- “Major success” should be shown as major within the relevant field

---

## Criterion 5 — Significant Recognition from Organizations/Critics/Experts/Government
### Definition
Significant recognition for achievements from organizations, critics, government agencies, or other recognized experts. Testimonials must clearly indicate the author’s authority/expertise and knowledge of achievements.

### Considerations
- “Significant” modifies the recognition source (who is recognizing), not only the achievement
- Testimonials should:
    - explain author’s credentials and basis of knowledge
    - describe achievements being recognized
    - establish significance of recognizing entity/person

---

## Criterion 6 — High Salary / Substantial Remuneration
### Definition
Commanded (or will command) high salary or other substantial remuneration relative to others in the field, evidenced by contracts or reliable evidence.

### Considerations
- Wage survey comparisons can help; ensure the occupational category is an accurate match
- Evaluate survey validity (some user-reported sites may be weak)
- Location/currency should be appropriate
- For artists paid per-day/per-project, provide documentation to make comparisons meaningful (hours, project scope, etc.)

## Comparable Evidence
O-1B (Arts) allows comparable evidence if criteria are not readily applicable, with a detailed explanation.
