# O-1A Evidentiary Criteria (Sciences, Education, Business, Athletics)

To support an O-1A petition, the petitioner must show either:
- A major internationally recognized award (e.g., Nobel Prize), OR
- At least **3** of the criteria below.

> Important: Meeting 3 criteria is a threshold. USCIS still conducts a “totality of the evidence” evaluation.

---

## Criterion 1 — Prizes or Awards
### Definition
Documentation of receipt of **nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards** for excellence in the field.

### Examples
- Awards from well-known national institutions or professional associations
- Certain dissertation awards and scholarships
- Awards for presentations at nationally/internationally recognized conferences

### Considerations
- Criteria used to grant the award
- National/international significance in the field
- Number of recipients
- Eligibility/competitor limitations
- Local/school/employer-only awards often carry little national/international recognition

---

## Criterion 2 — Membership in Associations Requiring Outstanding Achievements
### Definition
Membership in associations in the field that require **outstanding achievements**, judged by recognized national/international experts.

### Examples
- Select professional association memberships
- Fellowships (where selection is based on accomplishments)

### Considerations
- Must show the membership level requires outstanding achievements judged by experts
- Associations may have multiple membership tiers; must show the beneficiary’s tier required expert judging
- Factors that weaken this criterion:
    - Based solely on education/years of experience
    - Based only on paying a fee or subscribing
    - Compulsory for employment (e.g., certain unions)

---

## Criterion 3 — Published Material About the Beneficiary
### Definition
Published material in professional/major trade publications or major media **about** the beneficiary relating to their work. Must include title/date/author (and translation if needed).

### Examples
- Newspaper articles, journal articles, books, textbooks about the beneficiary’s work
- Major online publications about the beneficiary’s work
- Transcripts of major audio/video coverage about the beneficiary’s work

### Considerations
- Passing mentions are typically not “about” the beneficiary
- Broader-topic pieces can qualify if there is substantial discussion of the beneficiary’s work and the beneficiary is mentioned in connection to it
- Publication qualification factors: intended audience + circulation/readership/viewership

---

## Criterion 4 — Judge of the Work of Others
### Definition
Participation on a panel or individually as a **judge** of the work of others in the same or allied field.

### Examples
- Conference paper/abstract reviewer
- Peer reviewer for journals
- Dissertation committee member
- Reviewer for government research funding programs

### Considerations
- Must show actual judging occurred (not only an invitation)
- Documentation can include review requests plus evidence the review was completed

---

## Criterion 5 — Original Contributions of Major Significance
### Definition
Original scientific/scholarly/business-related contributions of **major significance** in the field.

### Examples
- Published materials about significance of the work
- Expert letters/testimonials describing the work and significance
- High citation levels indicative of major significance
- Publication in a distinguished journal
- Patents/licenses and evidence of impact/commercialization
- Evidence of commercial use of innovation
- Significant contributions to software/data/design repositories with impact evidence
- Detailed letter from an interested government agency explaining significance

### Considerations
- Funding/patents/publications alone may not prove “major significance”
- Strong indicators include widespread commentary, high relative citations, significant commercialization/attention
- Expert letters are more persuasive when specific and corroborated by independent evidence

---

## Criterion 6 — Authorship of Scholarly Articles
### Definition
Authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional journals or other major media.

### Examples
- Publications in professionally relevant journals
- Published conference presentations at nationally/internationally recognized conferences

### Considerations
- Beneficiary must be a listed author (not necessarily first/sole)
- Citations are not required for this criterion (though can help overall)
- “Scholarly” typically implies original research/discourse, peer review, references/bibliography, etc.

---

## Criterion 7 — Critical or Essential Capacity for Distinguished Organizations
### Definition
Employment in a **critical or essential** capacity for organizations/establishments with a **distinguished reputation**.

### Examples
- Faculty/research role at distinguished department/program
- Research role at distinguished institution, government/quasi-government entity, or company
- Principal/named investigator on merit-based government award (e.g., SBIR grant)
- Member of key committee/high-performing team within distinguished org
- Founder/co-founder or IP contributor to a startup with distinguished reputation
- Critical supporting role explained in detail by leadership

### Considerations
- Focus on duties + impact, not title
- Show role was integral/significantly important relative to peers
- Distinguished reputation factors: customer base scale, longevity, relevant media coverage, rankings, grants, significant funding

---

## Criterion 8 — High Salary / Remuneration
### Definition
Commanded (or will command) a **high salary** or other remuneration, evidenced by contracts or reliable evidence.

### Examples
- Tax returns/pay statements/past compensation evidence
- Offer letter/contract for future compensation
- Comparative wage data (BLS, CareerOneStop, compensation surveys)

### Considerations
- Must establish compensation is high relative to others in the field (location-appropriate)
- For non-U.S. work, compare to local wage statistics (don’t just convert currency)
- For founders, credible compensation evidence can include funding context and equity value as appropriate evidence

---

## Comparable Evidence (O-1A only)
If a criterion is not readily applicable to the occupation, petitioner may submit **comparable evidence** with a detailed explanation of:
- why the criterion does not readily apply, and
- why the submitted evidence is comparable in significance.

Still must meet at least **3** separate criteria (including those met by comparable evidence).

---

## Totality Considerations (Examples)
In the totality analysis, USCIS may consider other evidence, e.g.:
- Publication in highly-ranked journals (impact factor context)
- High total citations / high h-index relative to field
- Employment at leading institutions (rankings / research activity)
- Unsolicited invitations to speak at major conferences
- Named investigator on competitively funded grants
- Letters from interested government agencies attesting to sustained acclaim
