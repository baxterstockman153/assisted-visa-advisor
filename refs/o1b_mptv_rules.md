# O-1B (Motion Picture / Television, “MPTV”) Rules

## Classification Standard
O-1B (MPTV) requires a demonstrated record of **extraordinary achievement** in motion picture/television productions and intent to continue work in such productions.

**Extraordinary achievement** means: very high level of accomplishment with recognition significantly above the norm such that the person is outstanding, notable, or leading in the MPTV field.

## What counts as MPTV
USCIS may treat as MPTV:
- Streaming movies
- Web series
- Commercials
- Programs with traditional MPTV-like formats

USCIS generally does NOT treat as MPTV:
- Static web materials
- Self-produced video blogs
- Social media content (generally)

---

## Mixed work (Arts + MPTV)
If the beneficiary will perform services for MPTV productions in the U.S., USCIS generally applies **O-1B (MPTV)** requirements regardless of other non-MPTV services.

If an artist’s MPTV appearance is incidental (e.g., interviewed/promoting their art), O-1B (MPTV) may not apply and O-1B (Arts) may be appropriate.

---

## Evidence requirements
For O-1B (MPTV), petitioner must submit either:
- A significant national/international award or nomination (e.g., Academy Award, Emmy, Grammy, DGA), OR
- At least 3 of the evidentiary criteria (generally aligned with the Arts criteria framework)

### Important limitation
**Comparable evidence is not allowed for O-1B (MPTV).**

## Totality evaluation
After threshold evidence is met, USCIS evaluates totality to determine whether the beneficiary has extraordinary achievement in MPTV as defined by statute/regulations.
